# **GitHub Profile Picker**
===============================

## Motivation
This application was built with React and takes advantage of Github API. It allows users to get public information and repositories from a selected Github profile.

## The app's functionality
This application, after entering Github login, gives access to selected public information about Github user such as: name, email, contact and to the list of their repositories. The search area has a text input that may be used to find repositories. As the value of the text input changes, the repositories that match that query are displayed on the page. The user can open repositories in new tabs or hide them as well.

## How to start?
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`.
One can also find the application on: https://ewelina-w.github.io/github-profile-picker/
